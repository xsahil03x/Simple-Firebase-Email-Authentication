# Simple-Firebase-Email-Authentication

It is just an sample Email authentication app, details of which are as follows:

1. The app must ask first time users to enter their email id, name and set up a password.
2. Using the email id, a confirmation link must be sent to the user.
3. After confirmation whenever user logs in, user should see "Hello (name of user)".

Thank You.
